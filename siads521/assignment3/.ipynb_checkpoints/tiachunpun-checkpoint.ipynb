Whenever we have a piece of data that belongs in those axis, we plot them as a dot as shown. Now let's see what a bubble plot is compared to the scatter plot.\n",

    "Bubble plots show us not only the x and y dimension of data, but also the third dimension z, which is the weight of those data points, represented by the size of the circle as shown in the example above. Bubble plots utilize the Cartesian plane to show the relationships between the circles. Unlike scatter plots, the plotted points in bubble plots represent assigned labels or categories, and sometimes different colors are also used to distinguish between them. The overall plot can be used to determine patterns and trends in the data."

    "## When to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble plots are designed to visually convey three or four dimensions of data. It is a good idea to use bubble plots when you have such data that you want to convey all information graphically all at once. Moreover, as it is fundamentally a scatter plot with different plot sizes, it is also good to use it to convey relationships and correlation between those data points as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When not to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "The first mistake for choosing a bubble plot to display data is when such data can be explained better in terms of a pie chart. This means that if your data contains more dimensions than four, it is not advisable to crunch your data graphically into a bubble plot. The result of this can be confusion and incorrect analysis of data. Moreover, if many bubbles are included in the plot, this may overwhelm the audience, and so bubble plots usually have limited data size capacity.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, Seaborn is chosen as the library used to display our bubble plot. As quoted from their website:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\"Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is built on top of matplotlib and integrates very well with the Pandas library, which will be used to store tabular data. Seaborn allows declarative API that allows the user to control the elements of the plots with minimal setup, producing beautiful plots that are usually enough for people to interpret data. The library is developed by Michael Waskom in 2014 and is open-source. It includes built-in themes for styling informative data plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this library is chosen is because it provides easy-to-use APIs that integrate well with Pandas which produce results that are beautiful with not much effort to style the graph. It also integrates with Jupyter, showing graphs in-line."

    "You are hired as a data scientist at International Trade Administration Industry and Analysis National Travel and Tourism Office, a national bureau dedicating to enhancing tourism in the United States, and get involved in the **International Visitation and Spending in the United States** project. Towards the end of a fiscal year, you received a request from the headquarter to obtain insights based on the given tourist visitation number for different states in the U.S. Specifically, you are asked to produce a Jupyter notebook with visualizations that can interact with the 3-year US international visitation data and engage a meeting with various stakeholders, including the headquarter of national travel and tourism in a high-profile video conference."

To avoid confusion, when we join the datasets, keep every states that ever has international visitation data. Finally, order the state names alphabetically. "

Zipf's law states that given a large text corpus with many vocabularies used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. There is a wikipedia page talking about his academic contribution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kingsley_Zipf\n",

He observed these patterns and generalized that the $n^{th}$ most frequently occurring word has a frequency of $\\frac{1}{n}$ proportional to the most popular word!\n",
